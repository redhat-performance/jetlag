# Note for OCP 4.13 and newer releases the symbolic link for disks may not work on multidisk systems as disks can change
# symbolic links over reboots. Instead it is recommended to identify the by-path for each system type you have or by-id
# for each individual system.
# Examples "/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:67:00.0-scsi-0:2:0:0" and "/dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5002538e015790e7"
# If your machines are not homogeous per role then you may need to modify the output of the create-inventory playbook.
# Edit and adjust each machine's install_disk= to have the by-path/by-id reference instead of the symbolic reference
