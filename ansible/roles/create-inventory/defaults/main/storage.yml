# Note for OCP 4.13 the symbolic link for disks will likely not work as disks can change symbolic links over reboots.
# It is instead recommended to identify each node's WWID and use that with the path for /dev/disk/by-id/...
# Example /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5002538e015790e7
# Also note to do this correctly you will need to modify the output of the create-inventory playbook. Edit and adjust
# each machine's install_disk= to have the by-id reference instead of the symbolic reference
