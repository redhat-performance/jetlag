# Enter whether the build should use 'dev' (early candidate builds) or 'ga' for Generally Available versions of OpenShift
# Empty value results in playbook failing with error message. Example of dev builds would be 'candidate-4.17', 'candidate-4.16'
# or 'latest' (which would point to the early candidate build of the latest in development release) and examples of 'ga' builds would 
# be explicit versions like '4.15.20' or '4.16.0' or you could also use things like latest-4.16 to point to the latest z-stream of 4.16.
# Checkout https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp for a list of available builds for 'ga' releases and

# For 'ga' builds some examples of what you can use are 'latest-4.13', 'latest-4.14' or explicit versions like 4.15.2
# For 'dev' builds some examples of what you can use are 'candidate-4.16' or just 'latest'
