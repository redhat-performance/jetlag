# Sync an OCP release to the bastion/mirror registry. This simplifies adding a new
# release that could be different from the original release that was synced to
# the bastion/mirror registry during the initial bastion setup.
#
# Example Usage:
#
# ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/cloud03.local ansible/sync-ocp-release.yml
#
