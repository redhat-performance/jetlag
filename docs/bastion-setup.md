# Bastion Setup

This page covers the initial setup of the bastion machine for all Jetlag deployments. Complete these steps before following any deployment guide.

1. Select the bastion machine from the allocation. You should run Jetlag on the
bastion machine, to ensure full connectivity and fastest access. In Scale Lab and
Performance Lab environments, the first machine listed in the cloud's
`ocpinventory.json` file is used as the bastion by default. You can find your
allocation's machine list on the lab wiki. For IBMcloud, the bastion is typically
the first server listed by `ibmcloud sl hardware list`.

## Choosing a different bastion machine

By default Jetlag selects machines for the roles bastion, control-plane, and worker in that order from the lab's `ocpinventory.json` file. If you want a different machine as the bastion, download the ocpinventory JSON, reorder the entries so your preferred bastion is first, and set the `ocp_inventory_override` variable to point to your modified file:

```yaml
ocp_inventory_override: http://<http-server>/<inventory-file>.json

# or use a local path on the bastion
ocp_inventory_override: <LOCAL_FILE_PATH>
```

Set this variable in the "Extra vars" section of `ansible/vars/all.yml` before running `create-inventory.yml`.

2. You can copy your ssh public key to the designated bastion machine to make it easier to
repeatedly log in from your laptop:

```console
[user@<local> ~]$ ssh-copy-id root@<bastion>
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 2 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
Warning: Permanently added '<bastion>,x.x.x.x' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@<bastion>'s password:

Number of key(s) added: 2
```

Now log in to the bastion (with `ssh root@<bastion>` if you copied your public key above,
or using the bastion root account password if not), because the remaining commands
should be executed from the bastion.

3. Install some additional tools to assist you.

```console
[root@<bastion> ~]# dnf install tmux git python3-pip sshpass -y
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
...
Complete!
```

4. Setup ssh keys for the bastion root account and copy to itself to permit
local ansible interactions:

```console
[root@<bastion> ~]# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:uA61+n0w3Dht4/oIy1IKXrSgt9tfC/8zjICd7LJ550s root@<bastion>
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
...
+----[SHA256]-----+
[root@<bastion> ~]# ssh-copy-id root@localhost
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:fvvO3NLxT9FPcoOKQ9ldVdd4aQnwuGVPwa+V1+/c4T8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@localhost's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1
```

Now try logging into the machine and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added:
```console
[root@<bastion> ~]# ssh root@localhost
[root@<bastion> ~]#
```

5. Clone the `jetlag` GitHub repo

```console
[root@<bastion> ~]# git clone https://github.com/redhat-performance/jetlag.git
Cloning into 'jetlag'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4510, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4510/4510), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1531/1531), done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (2450/2450), done.
```

Change your working directory to the repo's `jetlag` directory, which we'll assume
for subsequent steps:

```console
[root@<bastion> ~]# cd jetlag
[root@<bastion> jetlag]#
```

6. Download your `pull-secret.txt` from [console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) into the root directory of your Jetlag repo on the bastion. You'll find the Pull Secret near the end of
the long downloads page, in the section labeled "Tokens". You can either click the "Download" button, and then copy the
downloaded file to `~/jetlag/pull-secret.txt` on the bastion; *or* click on the "Copy" button, and then paste the clipboard into the terminal
after typing `cat >pull-secret.txt` on the bastion to create the expected filename:

```console
[root@<bastion> jetlag]# cat >pull-secret.txt
{
  "auths": {
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "XXXXXXX",
      "email": "XXXXXXX"
    },
    "registry.connect.redhat.com": {
      "auth": "XXXXXXX",
      "email": "XXXXXXX"
    },
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "XXXXXXX",
      "email": "XXXXXXX"
    }
  }
}
```

If you are deploying nightly builds then you will need to add a ci token and an entry for
`registry.ci.openshift.org`. If you plan on deploying an ACM downstream build be sure to
include an entry for `quay.io:443`.

7. Execute the bootstrap script in the current shell, with `source bootstrap.sh`.
This will activate a local virtual Python environment configured with the Jetlag and
Ansible dependencies.

```console
[root@<bastion> jetlag]# source bootstrap.sh
Collecting pip
...
(.ansible) [root@<bastion> jetlag]#
```

You can re-enter that virtual environment when you log in to the bastion again
with:

```console
[root@<bastion> ~]# cd jetlag
[root@<bastion> jetlag]# source .ansible/bin/activate
```
