# Deploy a Bare Metal cluster via jetlag from a Scale Lab Bastion Machine quickstart

Assuming you received a scale lab allocation named `cloud99`, this guide will walk you through getting a bare-metal cluster up in your allocation. For purposes of the guide the systems in `cloud99` will be Dell r650s. The recommended way to use jetlag is directly off a bastion machine. Jetlag picks the first machine in an allocation as the bastion. There are [ways to trick jetlag into picking a different machine as the bastion](tips-and-vars.md#override-lab-ocpinventory-json-file) but are beyond the scope of this quickstart.

## Bastion setup

1. Obtain your first machine from the allocation from the [scale lab wiki](http://wiki.rdu2.scalelab.redhat.com/)
2. Copy your ssh keys to the designated bastion machine

```console
[user@fedora ~]$ ssh-copy-id root@xxx-h01-000-r650.example.redhat.com
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 2 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
Warning: Permanently added 'xxx-h01-000-r650.example.redhat.com,x.x.x.x' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@xxx-h01-000-r650.example.redhat.com's password:

Number of key(s) added: 2

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@xxx-h01-000-r650.example.redhat.com'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
[user@fedora ~]$
```

3. Update the version of RHEL that came on the bastion machine and reboot

```console
[user@fedora ~]$ ssh root@xxx-h01-000-r650.example.redhat.com
...
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.2 (Ootpa)

[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]# ./update-latest-rhel-release.sh 8.7

```

5. Setup ssh keys on the bastion and copy to itself to permit local ansible interactions

```console
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@localhost'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]#
```

6. Clone jetlag

```console
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]# git clone https://github.com/redhat-performance/jetlag.git
Cloning into 'jetlag'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4510, done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (2450/2450), done.
```

7. Download your pull_secret.txt from [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/) and place it in the root directory of jetlag

```console
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]# cat pull_secret.txt
{
  "auths": {
...
```

8. Change to jetlag directory, source bootstrap.sh

```console
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]# cd jetlag/
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]# source bootstrap.sh
Collecting pip
...
(.ansible) [root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]#
```


## Configure vars all.yml

Copy the vars file and edit it

```console
(.ansible) [root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]# cp ansible/vars/all.sample.yml ansible/vars/all.yml
(.ansible) [root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]# vi ansible/vars/all.yml
```

### Lab & cluster infrastructure vars

Change `lab` to `lab: scalelab`

Change `lab_cloud` to `lab_cloud: cloud99`

Change `cluster_type` to `cluster_type: bm`

Set `worker_node_count` if you desire to limit the number of worker nodes from your scale lab allocation. Set it to `0` if you want a 3 node compact cluster.

Change `ocp_release_image` to the desired image if the default (4.12.16) is not the desired version.
If you change `ocp_release_image` to a different major version (Ex `4.12`), then change `openshift_version` accordingly.

Only change `networktype` if you need to test something other than `OVNKubernetes`

### Bastion node vars

Set `smcipmitool_url` to the location of the Supermicro SMCIPMITool binary. Since you must accept a EULA in order to download, it is suggested to download the file and place it onto a local http server, that is accessible to your laptop or deployment machine. You can then always reference that URL. Alternatively, you can download it to the `ansible/` directory of your jetlag repo clone and rename the file to `smcipmitool.tar.gz`. You can find the file [here](https://www.supermicro.com/SwDownload/SwSelect_Free.aspx?cat=IPMI).

The system type determines the values of `bastion_lab_interface` and `bastion_controlplane_interface`.

Using the chart provided by the [scale lab here](http://docs.scalelab.redhat.com/trac/scalelab/wiki/ScaleLabTipsAndTricks#RDU2ScaleLabPrivateNetworksandInterfaces), determine the names of the nic per network for EL8.

* `bastion_lab_interface` will always be set to the nic name under "Public Network"
* `bastion_controlplane_interface` should be set to the nic name under "Network 1" for this guide

For Dell r650 set those vars to the following

```yaml
bastion_lab_interface: eno12399np0
bastion_controlplane_interface: ens1f0
```

Here you can see a network diagram for the bare metal cluster on Dell r650 with 3 workers and 3 master nodes:

![BM Cluster](img/bm_cluster.png)

Double check your nic names with your actual bastion machine.

** If you desire to use a *different network* than "Network 1" for your controlplane network then you will have to append some additional overrides to the extra vars portion of the all.yml vars file.
See [tips and vars](https://github.com/redhat-performance/jetlag/blob/main/docs/tips-and-vars.md#Other-Networks) for more information

### OCP node vars

The same chart provided by the scale lab for the bastion machine, is used to identify the nic names for `controlplane_lab_interface`.

* `controlplane_lab_interface` should always be set to the nic name under "Public Network" for the specific system type

For Dell r650 set `controlplane_lab_interface` var to the following

```yaml
controlplane_lab_interface: eno12399np0
```

** If your machine types are not homogeneous, then you will have to manually edit your generated inventory file to correct any nic names until this is reasonably automated.

### Extra vars

No extra vars are needed for an ipv4 bare metal cluster.

### Disconnected and ipv6 vars

If you want to deploy a disconnected ipv6 cluster then the following vars need to be set.

Change `setup_bastion_registry` to `setup_bastion_registry: true` and `use_bastion_registry` to `use_bastion_registry: true` under "Bastion node vars"

Append the following "override" vars in "Extra vars"

```yaml
controlplane_network: fc00:1000::/64
controlplane_network_prefix: 64
cluster_network_cidr: fd01::/48
cluster_network_host_prefix: 64
service_network_cidr: fd02::/112
fix_metal3_provisioningosdownloadurl: true
```

Oddly enough if you run into any routing issues because of duplicate address detection, determine if someone else is using subnet `fc00:1000::/64` in the same lab environment and adjust accordingly.

The completed `all.yml` vars file and generated inventory files following this section only reflect that of an ipv4 connected install. If you previously deployed ipv4 stop and remove all running podman containers off the bastion and rerun the `setup-bastion.yml` playbook.

## Review vars all.yml

The `ansible/vars/all.yml` now resembles ..

```yaml

## Run playbooks

Run the create inventory playbook

```console
(.ansible) [root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]# ansible-playbook ansible/create-inventory.yml
...
```

The `create-inventory.yml` playbook will create an inventory file `ansible/inventory/cloud99.local` from the lab allocation data and the vars file.

The inventory file resembles ...

```
[all:vars]
allocation_node_count=16

Next run the `setup-bastion.yml` playbook ...

```console
(.ansible) [root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]# ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/cloud99.local ansible/setup-bastion.yml
...
```

Finally run the `bm-deploy.yml` playbook ...

```console
(.ansible) [root@xxx-h01-000-r650 jetlag]# ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/cloud99.local ansible/bm-deploy.yml
...
```

## Monitor install and interact with cluster

It is suggested to monitor your first deployment to see if anything hangs on boot or if the virtual media is incorrect according to the bmc. You can monitor your deployment by opening the bastion's GUI to assisted-installer (port 8080, ex `xxx-h01-000-r650.rdu2.scalelab.redhat.com:8080`), opening the consoles via the bmc of each system, and once the machines are booted, you can directly ssh to them and tail log files.

If everything goes well you should have a cluster in about 60-70 minutes. You can interact with the cluster from the bastion.

```console
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]# export KUBECONFIG=/root/bm/kubeconfig
[root@xxx-h01-000-r650 ~]# oc get no
NAME               STATUS   ROLES                         AGE    VERSION
xxx-h02-000-r650   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   73m    v1.25.7+eab9cc9
xxx-h03-000-r650   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   103m   v1.25.7+eab9cc9
xxx-h05-000-r650   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   105m   v1.25.7+eab9cc9
```
