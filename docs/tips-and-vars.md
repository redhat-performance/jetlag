## Post Deployment - Network Attachment Definition

Append these vars to the "Extra vars" section of your `all.yml` or `ibmcloud.yml` to add a Macvlan Network Attachment
Definition. This allows you to add an additional network to pods created in your cluster.

```yaml
setup_network_attachment_definition: true
net_attach_def_namespace: default
net_attach_def_name: net1
net_attach_def_interface: bond0
net_attach_def_range: 192.168.0.0/16
```

Modify `net_attach_def_interface` to the desired host interface in which you want the macvlan network to exist. Modify
`net_attach_def_range` to an ip range that does not conflict with any other test-bed address ranges.

To have a pod attach an interface to the additional network, add the following example metadata annotation:

```yaml
annotations:
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: '[{"name": "net1", "namespace": "default"}]'
```
